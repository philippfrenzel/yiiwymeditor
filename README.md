Yii2 What You Mean Editor

Make WYMeditor 1.0.4 as widget available for Yii2:

http://wymeditor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/version_1.0_and_0.5/getting_started/customize.html#list-of-options

Will use this editor inside our internal company intranet, as it's very important to have a focus on meaning and not format.
We 1st thought about creole, but for none IT - Users, it was to "abstract" to work with that :(

Anyway, hope you can use it for your own project!
